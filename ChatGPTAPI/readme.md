`chatgptapi.py` is a super bare-bones implementation of the ChatGPT API (communicating through your console/terminal)

`chatapp.py` is also pretty simple. Communicating through a web app. The original implementation has it as a joke-bot (see video). However, I made a...

### Modification! ###
Instead of a jokebot, I made a bot that would write a Shakespearean sonnet about subjects/scenes I described.  
It did a pretty decent job, following the 3 quatrain + couplet structure, iambic pentameter, and abab-cdcd-efef-gg rhyme scheme.
Sample interaction:

**Input:** *Mice and cats*   
**Output**:  
*Amidst the fields, where harvest mice do play,  
Prowls feline foe, with stealth and deadly grace,    
With eyes ablaze, and whiskers to display,  
She stalks her prey with unrelenting pace.  
But though her fury may strike fear in all,  
The mice, undaunted, carry on with glee,  
As they frolic, and dance, and chase and crawl,  
Ever mindful of the risk that they see.  
For life may be but fleeting, brief and fast,  
And danger lurks around each corner bright,  
Yet some small joys, in moments that don't last,  
Can make existence oh so very right.  
So let the mice and cats dance merrily,  
For life is nothing but a symphony.*  
   
**Input:** *A cat chasing a mouse but deciding to befriend it instead of eating it*   
**Output**:  
*Amidst the verdant fields, in morning sun,  
A feline prowled with eye upon her prey,  
A tiny mouse, who fearless had begun  
To scurry forth, before the cat's dismay.  
But Fate is strange, and stranger still was she,  
For though the cat was hungry, bent on blood,  
She, for some reason set the mouse go free,  
And toward the field they bounded, friend to bud.  
Perhaps it was the beauty of the day,  
Or something deeper played upon the beast,  
But in the end, the cat did mend her way,  
And with the mouse, she shared a humble feast.  
Thus in this world, where danger's always near,  
It's love and friendship which dispel all fear.*
